# Grafanders

Grafanders is a fork of Grafana 9.3.2 with a few modifications, and a few added features available through configuration options.

## Modifications

When the time range is changed, an event with the following structure is sent to the parent frame:

```

  type: 'time-range-updated',
  from: '2023-04-04T07:00:39.881Z',
  to: '2023-04-04T10:26:02.504Z'
}
```

## Configuration section [grafanders]

### custom_stylesheet

Path to a local stylesheet, relative to the public folder. Can be used to mount in a custom stylesheet from docker.
